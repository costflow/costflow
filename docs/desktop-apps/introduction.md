## Troubleshooting

- Costflow canâ€™t be opened because the developer cannot be verified.
<p><img src="/img/costflow-cannot-be-opened.png" alt="Costflow cannot be opened" width="300"/></p>
Open `Terminal.app` and enter the following command (you may need to enter a password halfway through), then restart `Costflow`:

```sh
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Costflow.app
```
