Latest version: `v1.0`.

Costflow is a series of products for making plain text accounting easier, including `Syntax`, `Parser`, `CLI`, `Playground` and `Self-hosted Costflow Hub`, which let you keep accounting anytime, anywhere.

Costflow Syntax is the rule for parsing plain text to the accounting tools formats, such as Beancount, Ledger and hledger, etc.

You can try Costflow Syntax on [Costflow Playground](https://playground.costflow.io/) while you are reading. All products that support Costflow Syntax are listed on [Docs page](/docs/).

> Beancount is the only supported output format in current version.

## Features

- Simple transaction syntax.
- Account name replacements. E.g. bofa in your message will be replaced with Assets:US:BofA:Checking.
- Formula, make creating transactions with patterns easier, for sure.
- Get real time price for exchanging rate or stock, even cryptocurrency.
- Optional date input, the default value is "today" in your timezone.
- Optional Currency/Commodity code.
- Custom indent and line length.
- Insert time info to transactions.



## Commands

The 'command' is the first word/symbol of the texts (exclude date). Some commands are same with 'directives' in Beancount.

    ...
  ```
